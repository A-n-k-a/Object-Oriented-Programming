//White space means space characters, tabs, and new lines.
//A token is any sequence of characters that does not contain any white space.
//If one token only contains numbers, it can be converted to an integer or a double (or float, something like that).

//Scanner Methods:
//If scan is a Scanner object thenâ€¦
//scan.next() returns the next token in the input stream (as a String).
//scan.hasNext() is a boolean valued method that returns true if another token can be read from the input stream.
//scan.hasNextInt() is also boolean and returns true if another token can be read from the input stream and this token can be interpreted as an integer
//scan.nextInt() returns the next token as an integer.
